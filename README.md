# Pandas Challenge - Complete!

## Notice!
### Some variables are shared so the cells must be run in order! The kernal must be restarted and outputs cleared and the cells must be run in the correct order to output the correct dataframes for each step.

## What the Pandas?!

#### In this challenge we analysed purchase data from a game to see if we could break it down into meaningful insights.
**The calculations and data output are in the HeroesOfPymoli_starter.ipynb file.**\
**The kernal must be restarted and outputs cleared. some variables are shared so the cells must be run in order!**

## Three Observable trends based on the data

1. An overwhelming majority of the purchases are made by Males - 84% of the purchases were made by players who identified as male 
2. The Average Total Purchase per Person for Females is slightly higher than for males so females spend slightly more on average than males.
3. Nearly half the purchases are from players between 20 and 24 years old - 44.79% - this demographic purchases significantly more than other age groups.

Some additional observations:
* Some players purchased multiple times
* Final Critic and Oathbreaker are the most popular and most profitable items
